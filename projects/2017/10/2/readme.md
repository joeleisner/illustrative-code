# Hammer & Anvil

This example was made for day 2 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to make something representing the origins or meanings of your name. I decided to focus on my last name (which means iron worker in German), and built an animated hammer/anvil.

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to support light/dark themes.
