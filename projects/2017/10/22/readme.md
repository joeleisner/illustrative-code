# Ruby

This example was made for day 22 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to create something inspired by a piece of spam e-email that I recently received. I receive countless spam emails regarding the riches I will inherit from some Nigerian prince, so I decided to make a minimalistic ruby ðŸ’Ž.

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to make the HTML more contextual.
