This example was made for day 22 of the October 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to create something inspired by a piece of spam e-email that I recently received. I receive countless spam emails regarding the riches I will inherit from some Nigerian prince, so I decided to make a minimalistic ruby ðŸ’Ž.
