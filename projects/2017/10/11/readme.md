# Rainbow Loader

This example was made for day 11 of the October 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to work together with another Creative Sprinter. Unfortunately, I did’t know anyone else who I could collaborate with, but that didn’t stop me! I got some feedback from folks, and decided to build another HTML/CSS loader with a rainbow, bouncy-ball wave.
