# Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow

This example was made for day 7 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to use recreate a famous work of art using a material and technique of your choice. I recreated Piet Mondrian’s “Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow”.

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to support light/dark themes.
