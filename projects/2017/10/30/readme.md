# Creative Sprint Trophy

This example was made for day 30 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to create a trophy or another type of award to celebrate my Creative Sprint efforts! I created a “30 days of [#creativesprint](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/creativesprint/)“ trophy using 🏆.

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to support light/dark themes.
