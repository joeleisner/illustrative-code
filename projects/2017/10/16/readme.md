# Speech Bubble

This example was made for day 16 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to learn a new word and create something that represents it for [#nationaldictionaryday](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/nationaldictionaryday/). This piece is inspired by “conlang” (n.) - An invented language.

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to support light/dark themes.
