# Mailbox

This example was made for day 9 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to create something inspired by the Postal Service and their work for [#worldpostday](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/worldpostday/). I built a mailbox with an animated mailbox flag.

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to support light/dark themes.
