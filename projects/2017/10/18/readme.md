# iPhone 7+

This example was made for day 18 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to take something you use every day and remake it using completely different materials. I built my matte-black iPhone 7+ in HTML/CSS.

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to increase color contrast and support light/dark themes.
