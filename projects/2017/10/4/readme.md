# Plastic Bag

This example was made for day 4 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to create something using disposable plastic bags as your "primary material". I decided to take things digital and make a plastic bag from HTML and CSS.

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to support light/dark themes.
