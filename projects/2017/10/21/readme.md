# Pint o' Beer

This example was made for day 21 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to ask someone to tell you a story about their day and make something inspired by it! Instead of asking a friend for a story, I based the prompt on what a friend and I did that day: We went to an event where we drank beer, ate pickles, and pet some dogs ðŸ‘Œ (also, since this is prompt 21, pun intended).

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to support light/dark themes.
