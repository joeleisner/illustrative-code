# Sushi

This example was made for day 24 of the Oct. 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to find inspiration today in a tradition of a culture other than your own for [#UnitedNationsDay](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/unitednationsday/). I decided to make a little, minimalistic sushi to represent Japanese culture ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ.

This example was updated in Aug. 2021 to support light/dark themes.
