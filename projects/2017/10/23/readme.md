# Mini Synthesizer

This example was made for day 23 of the October 2017 Creative Sprint. The prompt was to make something inspired by a sound you heard that day. I decided on synthwave (80â€™s-sounding electronic) for that day's work-music, so I made a little mini synth (inspired by my M-Audio mini) ðŸŽ¶.
